                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>The Sidemen (formerly known as The Ultimate Sidemen), created on 19 October 2013, are a British YouTube group made up of Zerkaa (Josh Bradley), Miniminter (Simon Minter), TBJZL (Tobi Brown), KSI (Olajide "JJ" Olatunji), Behzinga (Ethan Payne), Vikkstar123 (Vikram Barn) and W2S (Harry Lewis).
                    They are the biggest YouTube group in the United Kingdom. The Sidemen are a group of friends who began playing video games online together in the early 2010s.
                    As the decade progressed, they branched out into more varied content and created a commercial brand from their name. Since January 2018, they have uploaded weekly videos to their group channel under the banner of "Sidemen Sunday".
                    They created a second channel called MoreSidemen in 2018, which was originally used for compilations, but evolved into a channel where multiple videos are posted a week.
                    In 2020, they made a third channel called SidemenReacts, where they exclusively post "reaction videos". In 2021, they created a fourth channel called SidemenShorts which utilises the YouTube Shorts section of the website.
